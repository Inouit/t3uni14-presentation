  note:
  We'll talk about how to "Optimize your working time". Your employers may already have sparkles in their eyes, but this talk is for you, Dark side workers. you who'll start every project with the same meaningless steps: installation and painfull configurations. We'll talk about comfort and lazyness.<br />
  I have to share with you : I'm lazy ! I'm from the kind of persons that hate and flee repetitive brainless tasks. Just think about this: How many time do you spend on starting a project before actually building some thing? Half a day? A day? Two days? (Oo you should think about resigning ;))<br />
  Clément, me and you, if you've think about your lost time once, we spend no more than two minutes before having fun. Only Two!<br />
  Don't think we design industrial websites. You can check on our projects, they're far from being clones. Our goal is to make your boring tasks automated, whatever your needs are and before you've seen the bottom of your coffee cup.<br />
  First, we'll explain you how you can save yourself a lot of time and pain with the installation process. Then, we'll show you our process, and how it should be inspiring you to rethink your workflow. Finally we'll explain you how a Yeoman generator could save lifes.<br />
  Let's start!
