note:
  We have hijacked Yeoman generator to do the painful job of building FCE (flexform, typoscript, localization files, assets inclusion, loops, ...) automatically. Once again, comfort resides in doing intellectual stuff, not repetitive ones. (cf. slide)<br /> After filling the big form (this generator is merely a big form), you can insert the new FCE in the backend and see raw datas in the frontend. Now you only have to refine the typoscript and build styles and scripts. That's it! I don't know if that will change your life, but I have to build 40 FCE for a website recently, and it save mine.<br />
  Conclusion: This generator, the phylosophy of work that we explain earlier bring us to this point: thinking about solution to avoid lost time is a very cost effective investment. Our process is flexible, adaptable, so, do me a favor : take it as foundation, break it, personnalize it. The solution that you will use must have been built for the needs of your team. It's the only way for it to be embrace without pain. It's the only way for you to save a valuable time.
