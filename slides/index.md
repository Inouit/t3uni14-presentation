  note:
  We will talk about "optimizing your working time". Maybe this kind of title could excite your boss, but in fact this conference is for you : the workers of the Dark side. You, who start every projects with the same steps : installation and painful configurations. We will talk about comfort, about lazyness.<br />
  I have to confess: I'm a lazy person! The kind of person that hate and flee repetetive tasks. Just think about this: How many time do you spend at the beginning of a project before making nice stuff? Half a day? A day? Two days? (Oo maybe, you should think about resign ;)).<br />
  Clément, me, maybe you if you have ever think about your lost time, we just spend two minutes before having fun. Just two minutes!<br />Don't think we chain website. You can check Inouit's realisations and see they are pretty diversified. Our goal is to make your boring tasks excecuted automatically, whatever your needs, before you've finished your coffee.<br />
  First, we'll explain you how you can save a lot of time during the installation process. Next, we'll show you our process, it could be inspiring for your workflow. Finally we'll explain you how a Yeoman generator could save a life.
  Let's start!
