note:
  There's a lot of optimisation to do during the HTML/JS/CSS building process. At Inouit, we use Grunt. Grunt is a task manager based on javascript (pretty easy for configuration and maintenance). With Grunt, you can launch pre/post-processor (auto-prefixer, Sass and coffeescript builder), inspect code, ... but mainly, you can automate this tasks by listening the save on your file... you see what comes? Yes! Edit a Sass file, save and watch your browser be refreshed automatically with your modification. You have to make test on screen, tablet and mobile? Come on, let Grunt do the job of synchronization for you.<bbr />
  Ok. You're ready to work, let's  talk about contents.
