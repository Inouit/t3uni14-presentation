note:
  So. The script did the job but what did it install? The first and main extension name is skinDummy. This plugin is the common configuration to all of your projects. As we already said, it's easier to add features than cleaning ones, so you have to find the perfect cursor, your ideal cursor, between necessity and comfort. When you'll find this perfect combination, this plugin will never change. If it doesn't change a lot of things in frontend, it lays the foundation you will override with your theme throughout the project : link between backend_layout and frontend templates, prebuilt menus, content queries, ... It can store too a Wysiwyg editor's configuration for example. Gather the most commons features to all of your projects in one place and you'll have your own skinDummy.
